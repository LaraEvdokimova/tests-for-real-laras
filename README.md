Dear reader,  

I am delighted to share with you a piece of my wits on how showing great courage and resilience in fighting back from a losing position to win the game makes a significant impact on life expectancy.  

You should aspire to live for more than a hundred years, you know, it is not that simple but achievable.  

Everything's cleared and polished if you take a challenge to lead a sporty life!  


Pros and cons  

I had broached the subject and learned that the person who made a decision once had not regretted it afterward.  

It should be discussed on a springboard to unleash the best qualities of your true self.  

Because looking good in your eyes is said to be the greatest reward to live a better life.  

My secret mission was made to spend extra time on my happiness and to prolong these minutes of joy.  

Easy come easy go!  

A long time ago, it was forgotten to make work easy. 

I think how had the stuff done.  

It was told to be perfect and forget about staying in touch with friends during the working day, which had almost the same effect as turning off the lightbulb.  

It was ordered to be tired of the responsibilities and monkey job.  

It should not be discussed with an argument to express my courage, passion, fire, and inclination to do my job with lightning and high quality.  

As a result, I was broken, upset, and unenergetic.  

All in all, it was needed to break the ice.  

And I started to imagine what helps me to save my soul within the tremble waters of time.  

What could we read if the library had not been razed to the ground?  

It must have been so drastic.  

Angry birds with their colorful and entertaining tricks and reactions will be said the right choice of playing computer games.  

Let it be a critical question for you; what is your main focus for today?  

They say people grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously; this is how a character is built.  

I have started to live my life from a blank sheet as the somewhat finished document, period.  

It is advised to spend more time with your family.  

It should be done by staying connected to your friends and social circle via relationship links.  

It makes sense to prevent depression from creating your ideas, your healthy habits, exercises to make a dramatic boost of your energy and inner forces.  

It should be an everyday decision to live like a hero, to take a meal like a sportsman, to grow better than an average person.  

It should be forced to remain more committed to reasonable goals and make life better and quality of living profoundly more significant to continue enlightening others who need you.  

It is called a way of the right leader who committed to improve the true self and translate these changes as leadership.  

 
In conclusion, my priorities have changed, and I understand myself better, I know who I am.  

And I wish you, my reader, have a new sense of meaning and purpose in your life.
